# AI-Powered Genome Sequencing & Human Intelligence Model

## Overview
This project leverages artificial intelligence (AI) and genome sequencing to analyze species' genetic information, ensuring harmonious coexistence between humans and animals. The system uses AI models to predict potential threats from organisms based on genetic sequences while also identifying safe and cooperative species. The project employs a Gradio UI interface for user interaction and runs on Google Colab.

## Features
- **Genome Analysis for Harmful Species**: Identifies species that may pose a risk to humans based on genetic patterns.
- **Human AI Threat Prediction**: Analyzes organism genomes to determine if they pose a danger, suggesting necessary actions.
- **Animal-Human Harmony Model**: Ensures species like snakes and monkeys do not harm humans, helping animals find appropriate habitats.
- **Gradio UI Interface**: Easy-to-use web interface for real-time analysis and predictions.
- **Colab Notebook Compatibility**: Designed for execution in Google Colab for seamless cloud-based computation.

## Technologies Used
- **Python**
- **TensorFlow** (for AI models)
- **Biopython** (for genome sequencing)
- **Gradio** (for interactive UI)
- **Google Colab** (for execution and testing)

## Real-Time Applications
- **Preventing Animal Attacks**: AI ensures snakes do not bite humans and monkeys do not harm people.
- **Biodiversity Preservation**: Guides animals to suitable living habitats without human conflict.
- **Medical Research**: Helps in studying genetic diseases and possible cures.
- **Wildlife Conservation**: Identifies endangered species and their needs.

## Installation & Usage
1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone <https://github.com/PSivaMallikarjun/EcoGenAI>
   ```
2. Install dependencies:
   ```bash
   pip install gradio biopython tensorflow numpy
   ```
3. Run the project:
   ```bash
   python main.py
   ```
4. Open the Gradio UI in the browser and input genome sequences for analysis.

## Future Enhancements
- Integration with real-time animal tracking sensors.
- Expansion to cover a wider range of species and threats.
- AI-powered conservation recommendations.
