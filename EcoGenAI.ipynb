        "How many times each of the letters A, T, C, and G appear in the selected DNA.\n",

        "\n",
        "However, we've been having a bit of trouble with the part that's supposed to find the pattern \"GATA.\" Even though we know one of the example DNA sequences (\"Bacterial DNA Fragment\") contains \"GATA,\" our tool is currently saying it can't find it. We're still trying to figure out why this is happening.\n",
        "\n",
        "**Challenges We Faced:**\n",
        "\n",
        "The main challenge we're currently facing is getting the tool to correctly identify the \"GATA\" pattern in all the DNA sequences where it should be present.\n",

        "**Next Steps:**\n",
        "\n",
        "The next step is to figure out why the pattern finding isn't working as expected. We'll keep looking at the computer code to find the problem and fix it. After that, we could think about adding more features to our tool, like being able to analyze longer DNA sequences or look for other interesting patterns.\n",
        "\n",
        "So, in simple terms, we've built a basic web tool that can look at short pieces of DNA code and tell you some simple things about them, but we're still working on making sure it can find specific \"words\" within that code correctly."
